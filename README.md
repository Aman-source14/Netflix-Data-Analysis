This project demonstrates data analysis using Python by solving various queries on a dataset through Python commands and libraries. Key operations include handling missing values, filtering data, and visualizing insights with Seaborn. Below are some Python commands and methods used:

- **Basic DataFrame Operations:** `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, `size`, `columns`, `dtypes`, `info()`
- **Data Inspection:** `value_counts`, `unique()`, `nunique()`, `duplicated()`, `isnull()`, `dropna()`, `isin()`, `str.contains()`, `str.split()`
- **Data Conversion and Aggregation:** `to_datetime()`, `dt.year.value_counts()`, `groupby()`
- **Visualization:** `sns.countplot()`
- **Statistical Functions:** `max()`, `min()`, `mean()`

**Additional Learning Points:**
- Creating new columns and DataFrames
- Filtering data with multiple conditions
- Using Seaborn for bar graph visualizations

**Tasks and Queries:**
1. Remove duplicate records.
2. Visualize null values with a heatmap.
3. Retrieve specific show information.
4. Analyze yearly release trends.
5. Count movies and TV shows.
6. Filter movies released in 2000.
7. List TV shows released in India.
8. Identify top directors on Netflix.
9. Filter records based on category and type.
10. Count movies/shows featuring Tom Cruise.
11. List different Netflix ratings.
12. Count movies with specific ratings.
13. Sort dataset by year.
14. Filter specific movie and TV show categories.

This project is a comprehensive introduction to data analysis and data science using Python, focusing on practical applications and data manipulation techniques.
